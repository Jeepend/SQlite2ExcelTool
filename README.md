# SQlite2ExcelTool
SQlite2ExcelTool is a tool to read data from SQLite db file and generate a excel file containing all the tables in the db.

It's using sqlite-jdbc to read data from SQLite db file, using POI to generate excel file, very simple logic, hope to help you^^

Later, I'll upload Golang version.
